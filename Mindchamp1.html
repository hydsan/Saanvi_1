                    The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering 'otter tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. 
                    Labs are famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, 
                    and they <b>socialize</b> well with neighbor dogs and humans alike.<br> But don't mistake his easygoing personality for low energy:

                    Often known as 'gentle giants', Bernese Mountain dogs have a <b>lovable, fun personality.</b>
                     When well socialised, they make one of the <b>best dog breeds for kids</b> as they're usually very <b>patient and kind.</b>
                     They're particularly well suited to <b>active households</b> with older children who like to engage in <b>outdoor activities</b>
                     <br>such as hiking, camping and exploring in nature. However, this family dog breed will <b>not 
                    be suitable for very small children</b> as they can easily knock them over and accidentally hurt them whilst playing.
